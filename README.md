- This repo contains the inference code to use pretrained human voice gender classifier.

## Installation
First, clone this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/JaesungHuh/voice-gender-classifier.git
```

and install the packages via pip.

```
cd voice-gender-classifier
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
```
import torch

from model import ECAPA_gender

# You could directly download the model from the huggingface model hub
model = ECAPA_gender.from_pretrained("JaesungHuh/ecapa-gender")
model.eval()

# If you are using gpu .... 
device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
model.to(device)

# Load the audio file and use predict function to directly get the output
example_file = "data/00001.wav"
with torch.no_grad():
    output = model.predict(example_file, device=device)
    print("Gender : ", output)
```

## Training details
State-of-the-art speaker verification model already produces good representation of the speaker's gender.

I used the pretrained ECAPA-TDNN from [TaoRuijie's](https://github.com/TaoRuijie/ECAPA-TDNN) repository, added one linear layer to make two-class classifier, and finetuned the model with the VoxCeleb2 dev set.

The model achieved **98.7%** accuracy on the VoxCeleb1 identification test split.

## Caveat
I would like to note the training dataset I've used for this model (VoxCeleb) may not represent the global human population. Please be careful of unintended biases when using this model.
